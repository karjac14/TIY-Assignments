The webpage shows a template for an online selling website. The website is
responsive. The website also have minimalist blue design.

There is a button or "switch" that changes the outline how the items are show.
The two modes are grid and list. The grid shows the large photos of the items
while the list shows smaller photos but the user can see more items at the
same time.

The javscrpt is ecpected to invloved in the behaviour of the switches. It can
take an input of click from the modes of the view. The output will give a
different container size (where the items are show). Another JS files also
the classes of the html object to change the behaviours.
