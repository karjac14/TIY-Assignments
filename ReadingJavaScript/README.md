##  Basic Literal Types types in Javascript:

* **Null** - its basically an "empty" or no value. 
    _Example is guess what... `null`._
* **Boolean** - its has a range of just true or false value, no gray area. 
    _Example: `True`, `False`_
* **Number** - its has a range of any number whether a negative value or positive as long as it has value. _Example: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4.5`, `5.36723786`, `6.6667`, `-5.03`, `-4`_
* **String** - its a collection of alphabets and/or numbers or any characters. Which are written inside apostrophe. _Example: `"dog"`, `"R2D2"`, `"You can do this!"` , `"Trump's shiny hair`"_

##  Basic Operators in Javascript:

* **Arithmetic** - are operations that are like mathematical operations 

      _Example: `+` (plus), `-` (minus), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `%` (remainder), `++` (counter or increment by 1)_
* **Comparison** - it does compare two values (one from left and one from right). ANd it returns a vlaue of `true` or `false`. 

      _Example: `<` (less than), `>` (more than), `<=` (less than or equal to), `==` (is equal to?)
* **Assignment** -  it assigns a value to a certain operator. The syntax for this is `=`. _

      _Example:  `var myColor = "green";` the operator myColor is assigned to have a string value of "green"
                 `var myFavNum = "5";` the operator myFavNum is assigned to have a number value of 5

##  Built-in constant in Javascript:

* **Undefined** - property that has not been assigned a value, javascript assumes that the property is unknown or undefined. 

      _Example: `var myName;   console.log (myName);`  // the JS will print `undefined` because the myName variable was not assigned of any value or type._


* **NaN** - it is a value that JS assumes to be unidentified number, it is ussually a result of a failed mathematical equation.

      _Example: `2 * "anyWord";` will result `NaN` because JS cannot interpret the equation of multiplying a number to a string._

* **Infinity** - it is numerical value that is infinite. In mathematics algebra, the symbol is âˆž.

      _Example: `5 / 0;` will result `infinity`. The a number divided by zero is infinity, same as in mathematics._

02 - Assignment

* 'Typeof' - an operator that returns the type of the an operand.

      _Example: `typeof "myName"; ` will result `"string"`
      
* 'Function' - refers to a subprogram that are consisted of set of operations and statements. `Function` are ussually are being called or invoked to to perform the set of operations.


03 - Assignment
##  Control Flow in Javascript:

* **Block Operators** "{}" - are consisted of two curly braces, where in set of statements are coded inside. These statements are ussually integrated with each other to do certain complex logic. 

If/else - is a conditional statement that has set of commands that executes `if` a specified condition is `true`. while a clause `else` executed commands when the condition is `false`.
