The webpage shows a sample of navigation buttons. Each buttons
has short text decription under each one. Another three buttons are nested
which also have some text under it. The DOM which in this case, is consisted of
an HTML, CSS and Javascript. The HTML is the backbone of the DOM, where in
different CSS and JS files are being "called" or linked.

The movements from the text when clicking the buttons are interactive. Looking
at the dev tools, the <li> is having class of "cbp-nttrigger".

Clicking the buttons activates the movement, and clicking again resets back the
the original potion of the texts under the button.

Linking a JS file that will control the bahavious of the buttons is needed.
Perhaps a JS script that accepts an input of click or hover will do. The JS
will also have an output changing the class of objects in the html.index
